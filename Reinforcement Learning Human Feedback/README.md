# :snail: CSC 580 HW#5  Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback (RLHF)

The goal of this assignment is to develop deeper insights in RLHF.
**Preliminary**

You should do this assignment on platforms that provides GPU support (and high RAM ideally) because it involves intensive computation.  Another issue is visualization (rendering color animation.  The code provided will run on **Google CoLab** but should be fine on most other platforms.

Details are written in the assignment page.  The start-up code and an auxilirary file are posted here:
- "Simple_RLHF.ipynb" -- Simple implementation of Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback (RLHF)
Students fill in the places indicated with "(*) TODO" (1-15). Sample outputs are baked in this notebook file but also in the html of this file
- "ppo_train_prompts.py" -- A file containing ppo training and evaluation prompts.
